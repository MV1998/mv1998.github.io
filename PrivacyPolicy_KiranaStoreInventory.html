        <p>Welcome to the Kirana Store Inventory App. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect the information provided by you when using the app. Please read this policy carefully.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2C3E50;">1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal information about you or your device. The only information processed within the app is the data that you, the user, enter manually. This data is only stored locally on your device.</p>
        <p>The types of information you may enter include:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li>Product details (names, prices, quantities, etc.)</li>
            <li>Revenue and profit figures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is solely used for the purpose of inventory management and does not get transmitted or shared with any third party.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2C3E50;">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Since no data is collected or stored by us, the information entered by you is used exclusively within the app to manage your store's inventory, calculate profit and revenue, and generate relevant reports. It remains on your device and is not shared or sent to any external servers.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2C3E50;">3. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We do not retain any personal data or user information. All the data you enter in the app is stored locally on your device, and you have full control over it. The app does not retain your information beyond the time that the app is being used.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2C3E50;">4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>As no personal data is stored by the app or transmitted over the internet, there are no servers or third-party services involved in processing or storing your data. Therefore, there are minimal risks to your data. However, we recommend that you regularly back up your data to avoid losing any information due to device issues.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2C3E50;">5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our app does not use any third-party services for analytics, advertising, or data storage. The app operates entirely offline, and no external servers or data collection tools are involved.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2C3E50;">6. User Consent</h2>
